FindCommonElementsInTwoArrays,
RemoveDuplicateFromAnArray,
returnDuplicatesElementsFromArray.........their logic will be same or different?

Short answer: the core ideas are related, but the logic is not exactly the same.
They often reuse similar techniques (like hashing or sorting), but the goal and flow differ.

Important Insight

Technique (Set / Map / sorting) → often the same

Logic & condition → different

Interviewers expect you to know WHY the condition changes

One-liner Answer (Interview Friendly)

The problems use similar data structures like Set or Map,
but the logic differs because each problem has a different goal—comparison, elimination, or detection
of duplicates.
